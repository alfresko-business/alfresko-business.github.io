The hills range in size from 30 to 120 meters and are covered in green grass that turns brown during the dry season, giving them their chocolate-like appearance. The origin of the hills remains a mystery, with theories ranging from coral reefs to volcanic activity. The Chocolate Hills have become a popular tourist attraction and are considered one of the natural wonders of the Philippines.</p>

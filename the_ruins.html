                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>The Ruins is the remains of the ancestral home mansion of the family of Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson and Maria Braga Lacson. It is situated in Talisay, Negros Occidental, Philippines. The mansion was built in early 1900s and inspired by Italian architecture.</p>
                <p>The Ruins was the ancestral mansion of the family of wealthy sugar businessman Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson built on a 440 hectare sugar plantation in Talisay City, Negros Occidental, in the early 1900s in memory of his Portuguese wife Maria Braga Lacson, who died during the birth of their 8th child. During the Second World War, Filipino guerillas burned it down as a countermeasure to prevent the invading Japanese forces from using it as a military headquarters. It burned for three days. The intention was to burn it to the ground.</p>
                <p>Known variously as the "Taj Mahal of Talisay", "Taj Mahal of Negros" and "Taj Mahal of the Philippines", it is in the private ownership of the great-grandchildren of Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson and Cora Maria Osorio Rosa-Braga. They have preserved it in its ruined state, among operational farmland, as a tourist attraction that can be visited for a fee or hired for events. It is open to daily visitors from 8am to 8pm for am entrance fee of PHP150 for adults, PHP100 for senior citizens or PWD, PHP 80 for students and FREE for children. The fee is PHP1000 for those who will take photoshoots.</p>
                <p>Right now, The Ruins has become a tourist attraction not just because of its history but because of its beauty that is perfect for picture taking. It is now in a private ownership of the great-grandchildren of Mariano and Maria who preserved its ruinous state despite being in the midst of operational farmland.</p>

                <h1>Story</h1>
                <p>Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson was living a sweet life, the youngest child of 8. He was the young, dashing and bachelor baron of a 440-hectare plantation in Spanish colonial-era Talisay City. As much as he worked hard, he was enjoying his young life to the hilt. One of his passions was seeing the world, and he often did so in the company of an equally wealthy friend.</p>
                <p>In one of his meanderings abroad, Mariano caught sight of Maria Braga – a beautiful, young Portuguese lady from Macau – in old Hong Kong. It was love at first sight. He did not hesitate meeting her and her father, a captain of his own ship. He thought, “Mariano and Maria – a match made in heaven!” He offered her marriage and brought her back home and raised a family in Talisay.</p>
                <p>Mariano and Maria’s married life was blissful. They were blessed with ten children – Victoria, Rafael, Mercedes (who later married a Javellana), Natividad, Sofia, Felipe, Consolacion, Angelina, Ramon and Eduardo. But it was not fashionable to have a small family in those times. The number of children a couple had also formed part of a family’s wealth. Maria became laden with an 11th child.</p>
                <p>Suddenly… the cruel hand of fate dealt a tragic blow. In some nasty twist of events, the pregnant Maria slipped in the bathroom and began to bleed. Her condition was so precarious that she wouldn’t even be able to take the rigors of travel to the nearest available full-fledged physician in the next town, now Silay City (site of today’s international airport). So Mariano had no choice; he frantically summoned his horseman to take what at the time was the fastest mode of transportation, a horse-drawn carriage, for fetching the physician who can attend to Maria.</p>
                <p>At the time, a horse-drawn carriage took two days to reach Silay. So Mariano had to suffer the four-day wait for the arrival of the carriage as he tended his wife. Sadly, both Maria and the baby passed on even before the doctor arrived. Mariano was devastated and heartbroken – the love of his life gone, taken by a freak accident. No mortal would have been able to fathom the depths of his grief.</p>
                <p>But he had to move on for the sake of his children. In one of those healing moments, he thought of a way to immortalize Maria in his memory for the rest of his life: build a mansion adjacent to his ancestral home. He wanted to dedicate it to Maria’s love, especially to their 10 children. He touched base with Maria’s father and told him of his plan to erect a grand palace in honor of Maria, where he and the kids would live as well as desert the scene of Maria’s tragic mishap. Mariano’s intentions was well-received by his father-in-law, who not only provided some finances but might also have given Mariano the design of his very own mansion.</p>
                <p>Construction of the Don Mariano Lacson Mansion went in earnest. Mariano entrusted the design and building specifications to a local engineer, Luis Puentevella, and asked one of his sons to supervise the construction and make certain that the A-grade mixture of concrete was precisely poured. It was finished to perfection, upon which the Don told his children the mansion was theirs to live in for as long as they are unmarried. The family cherished in the new mansion the loving memory of Maria. And life went on beautifully for them all from then on…</p>
